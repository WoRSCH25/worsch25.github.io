        <p>Chemical hypergraphs</p>
        Graphs have long found applications in chemistry as a par excellence model of molecular structures. However, not every molecular structure can be represented as a graph; in fact, only covalent molecules can. Although these constitute a large part of known compounds, other important classes—such as organometallic compounds and more complex molecular structures—still await an appropriate mathematical model. The challenge with non-covalent molecules is that they exhibit higher-order relations among atoms, rather than the typical binary relationships of covalent bonds. In this talk, I will present several cases of such higher-order atomic relationships and discuss how hypergraphs provide a suitable and comprehensive framework to capture the diversity of the molecular world.<br><br>

        Chemistry, however, is more than its substances: it also encompasses the methods by which these chemicals are produced or transformed. Reactions therefore constitute a central part of the discipline. From a mathematical perspective, a chemical reaction involves relationships among substances, which have traditionally been modelled using (directed) graphs. Yet graphs cannot capture the essential set-theoretical nature of reactions, namely the relationship between the set of reactants and the set of products. This is naturally represented by directed hypergraphs, which will be discussed in the talk.<br><br>

        Substances and their reactions together constitute the chemical space, which can be modelled as a gigantic network of directed hypergraphs. Recently, some features of this network and its temporal expansion have been analysed, raising questions about its nearness to random structures. This has motivated the development of an Erdős–Rényi model for chemical hypergraphs, whose properties will be presented.<br><br>

        The talk concludes with results on the temporal unfolding of the chemical space, which not only shed light on the practice of chemistry but also raise intriguing mathematical questions.

        <p>Beyond the Configuration Model: Descriptive Null Models for (Hyper)graphs</p> 
            Null models are essential tools for understanding complex networks: they generate randomized versions of a system that preserve chosen structural properties, allowing us to test whether observed patterns are statistically significant or simply due to chance. Classical null models have mostly been developed for simple graphs; however, many real-world systems are better represented by higher-order structures such as hypergraphs. At the same time, even in simple graphs, preserving additional constraints such as color assortativity can dramatically change the insights we obtain.<br><br>

            In this talk, I will present a family of null models we developed for three settings: bipartite graphs (linked to undirected hypergraphs), directed hypergraphs, and colored multigraphs. All of these models rely on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, with specialized swap operations — including restricted and parity swaps — that ensure uniform and efficient sampling of the corresponding ensembles.<br><br>

            Through case studies on purchase networks, endorsement data, and legislative co-sponsorship, I will show how selecting the appropriate null model and sampling it correctly yields qualitatively different insights into structural patterns. Finally, I will highlight ongoing work extending the idea of preserving color assortativity from graphs to hypergraphs, further expanding the scope of descriptive null models.

        <p>Models of random simplicial complexes and their topological properties</p>
            In my talk I will discuss the constructions of two major classes of probability measures on the set of simplicial complexes. I will present results on properties of random simplicial complexes under various assumptions on the probability parameters. The properties of random simplicial complexes which will appear in my talk include the Betti numbers, the fundamental groups, the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category, the topological complexity and some others.

        <p>Homological and Homotopical Properties of Preferential Attachment Clique Complexes</p> 
            The preferential attachment model is a natural and popular random graph model for a growing network that contains very well-connected ``hubs''. We study the higher-order connectivity of such a network by investigating the algebraic-topological properties of its clique complex. By determining the asymptotic growth rates of the Betti numbers, we discover that the graph undergoes higher-order phase transitions within the infinite-variance regime. Homotopically, we found similar phase transitions in the homotopy-connectedness of the infinite preferential attachment clique complex. This is a joint work with Gennady Samorodnitsky, Christina Lee Yu and Rongyi He. This talk is based on the articles https://doi.org/10.1017/apr.2024.66 and https://doi.org/10.1137/24M1693179</li>
    <li><h4>Jan Spaliński:</h4>
        <p>From Erdős–Rényi graphs to Linial-Meshulam complexes via the multineighbor construction</p>
            Neighborhood complexes, introduced by Lovász in his proof of the Kneser conjecture, have long served as a bridge between combinatorics and algebraic topology. The m-neighbor complex N<sub>m</sub>(G) generalizes this construction: its simplices are vertex sets in a graph G that share at least m common neighbors. In this talk, we investigate N<sub>m</sub>(G(n, p)) for an Erdős–Rényi random graph G(n, p) and identify parameter regimes in which the complex almost surely exhibits a sharply concentrated dimension. Under explicit growth conditions on m and p, the random complex has a complete (t−2)-skeleton, no t-faces, and (t−1)-faces whose marginal probabilities match those of a Linial– Meshulam (t−1)-complex Y<sub>n,t−1,q</sub>. We give precise formulas for t and q, prove concentration bounds that force the dimension lock, and compare the resulting distribution with the independent-face Linial–Meshulam model. Our proofs rely on binomial tail estimates calibrated to the m-neighbor threshold and union bounds over candidate faces. We also interpret N<sub>m</sub>(G) as a Dowker complex of the vertex–neighbor incidence relation, suggesting potential applications to topological data analysis. The presentation will outline the motivation from both topological combinatorics and random complex theory, state the main theorems, sketch the probabilistic arguments, and highlight examples illustrating the sharp transition in dimension.
